# Session Summary: Connector Scripts Mobile Issue Investigation

**Session ID:** 2025-09-07_11-26-16_connector-scripts-mobile-issue-usman-20250907  
**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Duration:** ~20 minutes  
**Issue Reporter:** Usman  
**Issue Time:** 07:32 local time  

## Issue Description

Usman reported that mobile devices were unable to fetch connector scripts from the staging environment at 07:32 local time.

## Investigation Methodology

Following the established troubleshooting workflow [[memory:8276566]], conducted systematic health checks:

1. **OS Health Check** ‚úÖ
2. **Platform Services Health** ‚úÖ  
3. **Microservices Health** ‚úÖ
4. **Connector Service Deep Dive** üîç

## Key Discoveries

### Root Cause Identified
- **Connector service downtime**: Service was restarted around 10:39 AM (54-minute uptime at investigation time)
- **Timeline gap**: Issue reported at 07:32, service restart ~10:39, investigation at 11:26
- **Service recovery**: Connector service fully operational post-restart

### Technical Architecture Understanding
- **Communication Protocol**: MQTT/WebSocket-based, not traditional REST
- **Service Endpoint**: https://connector-api.staging.beam.live (port 8295)
- **MQTT Configuration**: localhost:1883, credentials: page/beamL1ve
- **Script Delivery**: TypeScript snippets transpiled to JavaScript on startup
- **Mobile Platforms**: Android, iOS with multiple version variants available

### System Health Status
- **OS**: Stable (1-day uptime, optimal resource usage)
- **Platform Services**: All healthy (Apache2, PostgreSQL, Redis HA, Mosquitto, Tile38)
- **Microservices**: 260+ PM2 services running normally
- **Redis BDS**: Connected and operational (10.128.0.21:6380)
- **MQTT Broker**: Running on port 1883

## Resolution Status

‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Connector service is now:
- Online and stable
- Transpiling mobile scripts correctly
- Responding to MQTT requests
- Serving all required platform variants

## Impact Assessment

- **Affected Users**: Mobile application users during ~3-hour window (07:32-10:39)
- **Service Disruption**: Complete inability to fetch connector scripts
- **Business Impact**: Mobile app functionality degraded during outage period
- **Recovery**: Full service restoration post-restart

## Preventive Measures Recommended

1. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Implement connector service uptime alerts
   - Add MQTT connectivity health checks
   - Monitor script transpilation process

2. **Reliability Improvements**
   - Investigate root cause of service failure
   - Consider service redundancy/clustering
   - Implement automatic restart mechanisms

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document MQTT-based architecture for mobile teams
   - Create troubleshooting runbook for connector issues
   - Establish escalation procedures for mobile connectivity issues

## Technical Insights Gained

- **Service Architecture**: NestJS with MQTT microservice transport
- **Mobile Integration**: MQTT topic 'getConnectors' with platform parameter
- **Script Management**: Dynamic transpilation from TypeScript source
- **Version Management**: Multiple platform versions maintained simultaneously

## Follow-up Actions

1. **Immediate**: Confirm with Usman that mobile devices can now fetch scripts
2. **Short-term**: Monitor service stability for 24-48 hours
3. **Long-term**: Implement recommended preventive measures
