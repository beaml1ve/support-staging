# Session Notes: Server Restart with Increased Resources

**Session ID**: 2025-09-06_10-30-00_server-restart-increased-resources
**Started**: 2025-09-06T10:30:00.000Z
**Ended**: 2025-09-06T16:45:00.000Z
**Platform**: staging
**Type**: Planned Maintenance

## Objective
Restart the staging server with increased resources and validate all platform services and microservices are functioning correctly.

## Pre-Maintenance Preparation
- [x] Stopped all PM2 microservices (`pm2 stop all`)
- [x] Verified platform services status
- [x] Documented current system state
- [x] Prepared restart scripts

## Server Restart Process
- [x] Graceful shutdown of services
- [x] Server hardware resource upgrade
- [x] System reboot with increased resources
- [x] Platform services startup validation
- [x] Microservices restart and validation

## Key Actions Performed

### Platform Services Management
- Redis BDS cluster restart and memory loading monitoring
- Redis Bull HA cluster configuration and startup
- PostgreSQL replication status verification
- Apache2 web server restart
- Mosquitto MQTT broker restart
- Tile38 geofencing service configuration

### System Optimization
- Applied `BGREWRITEAOF` on Redis master instances
- Configured auto-start for Redis Bull services
- Set up Tile38 auto-start configuration
- Optimized kernel parameters (`vm.max_map_count`)
- Implemented log rotation for Redis Stack logs

### Microservices Management
- Used PM2 restart scripts for systematic service recovery
- Monitored service startup times and health
- Validated critical service dependencies
- Documented startup performance improvements

## Critical Discoveries

### Redis AOF Impact
- Large AOF files significantly impact Redis restart time
- `BGREWRITEAOF` should be applied before service restarts
- AOF file size directly correlates with memory loading time
- Calculated loading time estimates based on file size progression

### Service Dependencies
- Microservices must wait for Redis BDS and Bull readiness
- Master-slave Redis relationships must be established first
- Service startup order is critical for system stability

### Performance Improvements
- Microservices startup was 10-20x faster after proper Redis readiness
- Proper service dependencies eliminated connection errors
- System stability improved with correct startup sequence

## Files Modified
- `/etc/logrotate.d/redis-stack` - Redis log rotation configuration
- `/etc/sysctl.conf` - Kernel parameter optimization
- Various systemd service configurations for auto-start

## Commands Executed
```bash
# Redis management
redis-cli -h 10.128.0.21 -p 6379 BGREWRITEAOF
redis-cli -h 10.128.0.21 -p 6379 INFO replication

# PM2 management
pm2 stop all
./pm2-restart/pm2-daemon-restart.sh
./pm2-restart/pm2-simple-state.sh restore

# System monitoring
systemctl status redis-stack-server@bds*
systemctl status redis-stack-server@bull*
systemctl status tile38@beamdevlive
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Pre-restart Optimization**: Always apply `BGREWRITEAOF` before Redis restarts
2. **Service Dependencies**: Ensure proper startup order and readiness checks
3. **Auto-start Configuration**: Critical services must be configured for automatic startup
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of service loading progress is essential
5. **Documentation**: Detailed session documentation enables future reference and handoffs

## Next Steps
- [ ] Schedule regular `BGREWRITEAOF` operations
- [ ] Implement automated service dependency checks
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards for service health
- [ ] Document optimal restart procedures for future maintenance

## Session Outcome
âœ… **SUCCESS**: All platform services and microservices restored to full functionality
- System fully operational at 2025-09-06T16:45:00.000Z
- Performance improvements observed in microservice startup times
- Enhanced system stability through proper service configuration
- Comprehensive documentation created for future reference
