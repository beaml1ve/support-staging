# Chat History: Server Restart with Increased Resources

**Session ID**: 2025-09-06_10-30-00_server-restart-increased-resources
**Platform**: staging
**Duration**: 2025-09-06T10:30:00.000Z to 2025-09-06T16:45:00.000Z

## Chat Context for Continuation

This session involved a planned maintenance window for restarting the staging server with increased resources. The session included comprehensive platform service management, Redis optimization, and microservice recovery.

### Key Discussion Points

#### Redis Management and Optimization
- **BGREWRITEAOF Application**: Discussed the critical importance of applying `BGREWRITEAOF` before Redis restarts to minimize reload time
- **AOF File Size Impact**: Analyzed the relationship between AOF file size and Redis memory loading time
- **Loading Time Calculations**: Developed methods for estimating Redis loading completion based on file size progression
- **Master-Slave Dependencies**: Established the requirement for Redis readiness before microservice startup

#### PM2 Microservices Management
- **Startup Dependencies**: Confirmed that microservices must wait for Redis BDS and Bull readiness
- **Performance Improvements**: Observed 10-20x faster startup times with proper Redis dependencies
- **Error Classification**: Distinguished between critical errors (`econnreset`, `timeout`) and non-critical warnings (`SchemaService`)
- **Restart Scripts**: Utilized systematic PM2 restart scripts for reliable service recovery

#### System Configuration and Optimization
- **Auto-start Configuration**: Configured Redis Bull and Tile38 services for automatic startup
- **Kernel Parameters**: Optimized `vm.max_map_count` for improved system performance
- **Log Management**: Implemented log rotation for high-volume Redis Stack logs
- **Service Dependencies**: Established proper startup order for platform stability

#### Documentation and Process Improvement
- **Session Documentation**: Created comprehensive session logs with timestamps and metrics
- **Lessons Learned**: Captured critical insights about Redis optimization and service dependencies
- **Future Procedures**: Documented optimal restart procedures for future maintenance windows
- **Performance Metrics**: Recorded startup times and system improvements

### Technical Achievements

1. **Successful Resource Upgrade**: Server restart completed with increased resources
2. **Service Recovery**: All 260+ microservices restored to full functionality  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Significant improvements in startup times and system stability
4. **Configuration Enhancement**: Auto-start and dependency management improvements
5. **Documentation Creation**: Comprehensive session documentation for future reference

### Critical Rules Established

- **Pre-restart Optimization**: Always apply `BGREWRITEAOF` before Redis service restarts
- **Service Dependencies**: Do not start microservices until Redis BDS and Bull instances are up, loaded, and master-server relations established
- **Monitoring Requirements**: Use real-time monitoring for service loading progress with timestamp-based calculations
- **Auto-start Configuration**: Critical services must be configured for automatic startup after reboot

### Session Outcome

âœ… **SUCCESSFUL MAINTENANCE**: System fully operational with improved performance and enhanced configuration for future reliability.
