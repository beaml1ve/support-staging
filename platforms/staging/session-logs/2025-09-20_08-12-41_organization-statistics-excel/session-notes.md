**Platform**: staging

## Objective
Create comprehensive organization statistics Excel sheet with hierarchy analysis

## Key Actions
- [x] Extract all active organizations from Redis BDS config
- [x] Count active users for each organization
- [x] Count non-beamer users (pending status)
- [x] Count registered users
- [x] Determine parent organization hierarchy
- [x] Create hierarchy columns for sorting
- [x] Generate final Excel files with complete statistics

## Notes
**COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - Created comprehensive organization statistics with hierarchy analysis

### Key Achievements:
1. **Organization Extraction**: Successfully extracted 222 active organizations from Redis BDS
2. **User Statistics**: Counted 31,446 total active users across all organizations
3. **User Categories**: 
   - 2,765 registered users
   - 5,321 non-beamer users (pending status)
4. **Hierarchy Analysis**: Discovered 5-level hierarchy structure with cudb-root as root
5. **Excel Generation**: Created two final Excel files with complete statistics
6. **Session System Fix**: Created platform-specific session management scripts

### Technical Challenges Solved:
- **Redis Query Issues**: Fixed serviceId escaping for special characters in tag expressions
- **Hierarchy Complexity**: Discovered hierarchy stored in individual organization databases
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Successfully queried 222 individual organization databases
- **Data Structure**: Created sortable hierarchy columns for Excel analysis
- **Session Management**: Fixed platform session system to use local scripts instead of root scripts

### Final Deliverables:
- `organizations_true_hierarchy_20250920_075113.xlsx` - Complete flat table with all statistics
- `organizations_hierarchy_columns_20250920_080537.xlsx` - Hierarchy columns for sorting

### Session System Fix:
- **Problem**: Platform was using root session scripts, creating sessions in wrong location
- **Solution**: Created platform-specific session management scripts in `scripts/` folder
- **Result**: Sessions now properly created in platform's `session-logs/` folder
- **Files Created**: `scripts/open-session.js`, `scripts/close-session.js`, `scripts/session-status.js`, `scripts/list-sessions.js`

## Investigation Timeline

**13:12** - **Session Started:** organization-statistics-excel
- Objective: Create Excel sheet with organization statistics and hierarchy
- Initial request: Extract organizations from Redis BDS config

**13:15** - **Redis BDS Query Development:** Initial organization extraction
- Used FT.SEARCH on beamdevlive:config:type index
- Filtered by type: service:cudb and objectStatus: active
- Extracted 222 active organizations

**13:20** - **Excel Structure Refinement:** Changed from horizontal to vertical layout
- User feedback: Organizations should be in rows, not columns
- Created organizations_list_20250919_131223.xlsx with proper structure

**13:25** - **User Counting Implementation:** Added active user counts
- Challenge: Initial queries returned 0 users for most organizations
- Discovery: Users stored hierarchically under cudb-root and cudb-live
- Solution: Each user has serviceId property indicating actual organization

**13:30** - **Redis Escaping Fix:** Resolved serviceId tag expression issues
- Problem: Special characters in serviceId (hyphens) not escaped
- Solution: Implemented escape_redis_tag function
- Result: Accurate user counts for all 222 organizations

**07:06** - **Non-Beamer Users:** Added second user category
- Criteria: persistent.static.nonBeamer property + pending status
- Counted 5,321 non-beamer users across organizations

**07:14** - **Registered Users:** Added third user category
- Criteria: register.status = "registered"
- Counted 2,765 registered users across organizations

**07:33** - **PostgreSQL Integration:** Tested database connections
- Connected to localhost:5432 with beam/beamL1ve credentials
- Discovered: Each organization has separate database (<serviceId>-dev)

**07:45** - **Parent Hierarchy Investigation:** Attempted to find organization parents
- Initial approach: Query main postgres database cudb-relation table
- Problem: Only found cudb-root as parent for most organizations
- Discovery: Hierarchy stored in individual organization databases

- Solution: Query each organization's individual database
- Query: Find groupId=1 in cudb-relation table to get parent
- Result: Successfully identified complex multi-level hierarchy

**08:05** - **Hierarchy Columns Creation:** Final Excel structure
- Created Level_0 through Level_4 columns showing complete hierarchy path
- Maximum depth: 5 levels (cudb-root → Level_1 → Level_2 → Level_3 → Level_4)
- Enables sorting by hierarchy: Level_0, Level_1, Level_2, Level_3, Level_4

- ✅ Generates summary statistics for object counts

### BDS Object Structure:
**BDS (Beam Data Store) objects have the following key structural properties:**

#### Page Object Types:
**Page BDS objects have `persistent.static.metadata.type` property with valid types:**
1. **"ai"** - AI-related pages
2. **"assist"** - Assistant pages
3. **"broadcast"** - Broadcast pages
4. **"event"** - Event pages
5. **"friend"** - Friend-related pages
6. **"iot"** - IoT (Internet of Things) pages
7. **"regular"** - Regular pages

#### Partition Array:
**All BDS objects contain a `partition` array that contains tags.**
- The partition array is used for organizing and categorizing BDS objects
- Tags within the partition array help with data organization and retrieval
- This is a fundamental structural element of all BDS objects

#### Tag Format:
**Tags in the partition array are strings in the format "type:value"**
- Each tag follows the pattern: `"type:value"`
- Examples: `"service:cudb"`, `"status:active"`, `"org:beamdevlive"`
- This format allows for structured categorization and filtering of BDS objects
- The type prefix enables efficient querying and organization of related objects

#### Organization Membership:
**When an object belongs to an organization, it gets the "org:<serviceId>" tag**
- Objects are tagged with their organization using the pattern: `"org:<serviceId>"`
- Examples: `"org:cudb-root"`, `"org:cudb-client"`, `"org:org-mhamt01"`
- This enables efficient querying of all objects belonging to a specific organization
- Organization membership is a fundamental categorization in the BDS system

#### Index Structure:
**BDS indices contain partitionSegments and partitions index segments**

##### partitionSegments:
- **Separates tags using ":" separator** to create an array (of arrays)
- **Flattens the result** for efficient querying
- **Enables selection by type and value** separately
- Example: Tag `"org:cudb-root"` becomes `["org", "cudb-root"]` in partitionSegments
- This allows queries like: `@type:{org}` or `@value:{cudb-root}`

##### partitions:
- **Contains the full tag string** of the original tags
- **Is a TAG type index segment** for exact matching
- **Preserves complete tag strings** unchanged
- Example: Tag `"org:cudb-root"` remains `"org:cudb-root"` in partitions
- This allows queries like: `@partition:{org\\:cudb-root}`

##### Dual Structure Benefits:
- **partitionSegments**: Enables flexible type/value-based filtering
- **partitions**: Enables exact tag matching
- This dual structure provides both granular and exact querying capabilities
- Understanding this structure is crucial for effective BDS queries and data organization

#### Organization Object Selection:
**To select objects tagged to an organization from a BDS type, use the partitions query:**
- **Query Pattern**: `@partitions:{"org:<serviceId>"}` (properly escaped)
- **Example**: `@partitions:{"org\\:cudb-root"}` or `@partitions:{"org\\:org-mhamt01"}`
- **Usage**: This leverages the TAG type index segment for exact organization membership matching
- **Escape Special Characters**: Colons and other special characters must be escaped with backslashes
- **Efficient Querying**: Uses the partitions index for fast exact tag matching
